# Small datapack that add limited number of life

Add a little bit of difficulty when playing in hard mode by limiting the number of time players can respawn.

By default players have 5 lives. If they use them all they will be put in spectator mode

## Usage

Reset :

```console
/function hard:reset
```

Add life to a player

```console
/scoreboard player set @p lives <nb of life>
```
